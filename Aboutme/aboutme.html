        <h1 class="mt-0 mb-1">Something about me</h1>
                <p>I've been passionate about <strong>photography</strong> and <strong>cinema</strong> since I was 12 years old. From a young age, I nurtured my love for visual art, dedicating myself to image-making and storytelling through the lens of my camera.</p>
                
                <p>I was fortunate to fulfill my dream by working for a major film company, where I had the opportunity to explore the world of cinema and put <strong>my creative skills into practice</strong>. However, I found that I didn't feel fully accomplished in that role and started to reflect on my future ambitions.</p>
                
                <p>After finishing high school, I started working in photography and continued to cultivate my passion through specialized training courses.<strong> Photography</strong> continued to be a big part of my life, but I've felt a strong pull towards <strong>computer science</strong> in recent years.</p>
                
                <p>I realized that technology is becoming more and more central to every sector, including the creative industry. I am fascinated by the infinite possibilities offered by the fusion of photography and information technology, such as digital image processing, augmented reality, and the creation of innovative visual experiences. I decided to follow this passion for <strong>computer science</strong> and started dedicating my time and energy to learning the necessary technical skills.</p>
                
                <p>I am convinced that <strong>information technology</strong> is my future and that it offers me the opportunity to combine my artistic creativity with technological skills, opening up new professional horizons. I am striving to acquire knowledge in the field of web development, image processing, and artificial intelligence applied to visual art.</p>
                
                <p>I am excited about this new direction and am determined to pursue a career that allows me to combine my passion for photography with the challenges of computing. I am open to new opportunities and collaborations that allow me to put my skills into practice and contribute significantly to the world of art and technology.</p>
                
                <p>I am grateful for my journey thus far, as it has helped me discover my true calling. I am confident that my enthusiasm, determination, and unique combination of skills will lead me to a promising future in computing.</p>

        <h1>Production Assistant Skills</h1>
            <p><strong>As a production assistant</strong>, I have acquired a wide range of valuable skills and knowledge which have enabled me to carry out my responsibilities effectively and contribute to the success of productions. Here are some of the main skills I have developed in the role:</p>
        
            <h2>Organization and Planning</h2>
            <p>I have <strong>learned</strong> how to successfully manage complex production schedules, scheduling schedules, coordinating resources and making sure all tasks are performed efficiently. I learned to prioritize, meet deadlines, and manage resources to maximize efficiency.</p>
            
            <h2>Set Coordination</h2>
            <p>As a production assistant, I gained <strong>skills</strong> in set coordination. I've learned how to communicate effectively with the cast and crew, making sure everyone has the information they need and is aligned with the production's goals. I have developed good problem-solving skills, dealing with unexpected and stressful situations quickly and effectively.</p>
            
            <h2>Budget Management</h2>
            <p>I have had the opportunity to work with production budgets, tracking expenses, tracking costs and making sure funds are being used efficiently and within established guidelines. I learned how to negotiate contracts and manage suppliers to get the maximum value for our investments.</p>
            
            <h2>Resource Management</h2>
            <p>I have developed skills in <strong>human and material resource management</strong>. I learned how to recruit, select and coordinate support personnel, such as production workers, technical assistants, and interns. I also learned how to manage inventory and coordinate the purchase and use of equipment and materials needed for production.</p>
            
            <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
            <p>The experience as a production assistant has taught me to deal with and solve a variety of problems and challenges that can arise during a production. I learned to think creatively, make quick decisions, and find innovative solutions to overcome obstacles.</p>
            
            <h2>Collaboration and Communication</h2>
            <p>I have worked closely with several people and departments within a <strong>production</strong> including directors, producers, technicians, and talent. I learned to communicate effectively, to work in a team, and to collaborate to achieve common goals.</p>
            
            <p>These are just some of the skills I've developed as a production assistant. I am proud of my experiences and I am ready to make these skills available to contribute to the success of new productions and projects.</p>
